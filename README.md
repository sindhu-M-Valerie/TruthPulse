Real-Time Intelligence on Emerging Digital Harm/ Tracking Patterns. Protecting Truth.

TruthPulse is a real-time civic risk intelligence platform designed to monitor emerging misinformation campaigns, coordinated hate activity, and online exploitation risks across India’s digital ecosystem.

Operating as a 24/7 signal dashboard, TruthPulse aggregates publicly available data, verified reports, and trend signals to identify coordinated narrative amplification and harmful campaign patterns. The platform prioritizes behavioral analysis and ecosystem-level insights rather than amplifying harmful content.

Built with a Trust & Safety-first approach, TruthPulse aims to support researchers, digital safety teams, journalists, and policymakers in understanding evolving online risks and strengthening digital resilience.
